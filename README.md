# AlphaCulpa
Improved Columbia University Course Review System for CS Classes

This is a react project!

To run the code, cd into the alphaculpa folder.

We used third party packages for cookies (which have been disabled right now but the package still needs to be installed) and one for saving PDFs

To install the packages run:

npm install js-cookie
npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom --save-dev


Then, run npm start to launch the react server and the website in a browser.
