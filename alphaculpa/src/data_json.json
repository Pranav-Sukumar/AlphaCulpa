              "Topic": "Distributed systems help programmers aggregate the resources of many networked computers to construct highly available and scalable services. Most of the applications and services we interact with today are distributed, some at enormous scales. This class teaches design and implementation techniques that enable the building of fast, scalable, fault-tolerant distributed systems. Topics include distributed communication models (e.g., sockets, remote procedure calls, distributed shared memory), distributed synchronization (clock synchronization, logical clocks, distributed mutex), distributed file systems, replication, consistency models, fault tolerance, distributed transactions, agreement and commitment, Paxos-based consensus, MapReduce infrastructures, scalable distributed databases. The class combines concepts and algorithms with descriptions of real-world implementations at Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, LinkedIn, etc. In addition to lectures, students will get hands-on experience building distributed systems through a series of coding-oriented homeworks. The series, adopted from MITâ€™s course, implements a fault-tolerant, sharded key/value store.",
              "Grading": "The grade will be assigned on performance of five homeworks and a final exam. Additionally, a 10% extra credit may be awarded to students with significant and particularly insightful contributions on ED and/or in class throughout the semester. There is no specific number of these awards, but you should think of awardees as people who have stood out consistently and have improved the class in some significant way. Finally, a 10% extra credit is given to students who complete and score perfectly on all eight homework components. The first lecture details the grading procedure, and the Deadlines page specifies the deadlines/dates of each homework/quiz.",

If so, this is the right course for you. This course provides an introduction to computer networks and the technical foundations of the Internet, including applications, protocols, algorithms for routing and transport congestion control, data link and physical layer over wired and wireless medium. We will cover core network layers with a top-down approach, starting from applications we all use every day in order to derive the requirements they place on the network, moving to how the layers below the applications provide these requirements. The course assumes students have background in computer science and/or electrical engineering, but it does not assume background in networks. Laboratory projects are an integral part of the course in which networking concepts are explored in depth.The course breaks down into lectures, assignments, quizzes, written exams, and a course project. The projects will run for the last two weeks of the course. There will be no formal lectures or quizzes during the last two weeks of the course, but only invited talks from guests in the networking industry. The hope is that students can better focus on their group projects and in the meantime learn perspectives from the industry. The projects will be organized around a design review, code review and a final project presentation. ",
